A simple game that turned from a running/jumping to something similar to an old "chopper" game I remember (not sure what the name is)

The goal of the game is to avoid the green blocks using your red "chopper". 
Holding down the mouse button propels you up, let it go and gravity will pull you down. 

Survive for the longest time possible!
